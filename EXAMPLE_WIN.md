# Example in WIN

## there are two way to get protoc compiler:
* download the release for win `protoc-3.17.3-win32.zip`.
* use nmake build "protoc.exe" from source code.

NOTICE : the first way can not get the "include" and "lib" for our visual studio project, we can copy from "/usr/local/include" and "/usr/local/lib" where we build from source code and make install in linux.
